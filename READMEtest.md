# Employee Directory

## Description

The scope of this project is to create a dynamic employee directory. In order to create this, a user would run the program and will be presented with various questions starting with, "what type of employee would you like to log?". The user will then have the option to select a manager, intern, engineer or opt out of the questions and go directly to the rendered HTML. Depending on the role selected, the user will be presented with different questions pertaining to each role and at the end of each series of questions, user will be presented with the option of creating another employee or going directly to the rendered HTML. Once selected on the latter option, a new team.html will render and the new team will be displayed.
